Technology has benefitted my mental and physical health both positively and negatively. I’m the positive aspects it has allowed me to navigate through my days easier and helps me learn new things daily. The negative aspect is that I can quickly become engulfed in technology and won’t have time to do other things. I tend to become fixated on technology since the scope is extremely large. ,"My current mental health habit would be over thinking. This is something that is prevalent in a lot of people. Technology is all about helping people in the day to day lives by making daily tasks simpler and easier to get through. I believe that technology can alleviate the effects of this habit by taking some of the things off of the mind of an over thinker. If there was an app where people could write down all of their thoughts and be able to view them after an extended period of time, I think that would be beneficial to them. This would give people a space to vent and also give them the opportunity to revisit those feelings at a later date and see if there have been any changes in their way of thinking. Utilizing technology this way would make this habit somewhat beneficial as it could provide self reflection. "

Technology provides access to lots of resources directly through podcasts and information from the internet. It can also be used as a tool to gain mental health help from other people, for example being able to call resources like kidshelplike or booking an appointment online with a therapist.

","Technology could help my current mental health habits by, automatically turning off my lights when I should be going to sleep, to give my body cues for bedtime. Or having a automatic bookshelf to take out and put back my journal so I track my habits lore consistently at night. I’d also find it beneficial to have a device that asks for a vocal diary log of how each of my workouts go so that I could reflect on what went well, what did not, and use that to do more efficient and effective workouts. Next, I would be very fascinated by an easy to use, at-home device that can track the levels of different vitamins in your body, to avoid taking unnecessary amounts of vitamins and alert people with low levels of vitamins. This could be especially helpful in Ottawa where vitamin D levels diminish significantly in Winter!

Another habit that I have is calling my family, particularly my mother since I am very close to her and she is my biggest role model. Talking to my family at the end of a busy schedule makes me very happy just to hear what they have done and it makes me feel like I am part of their lives. Finally, one thing that brings me great joy and happiness after a busy day is making LEGO. The process of making LEGO and putting on a good movie is my ideal way to spend my day after having a busy schedule.","My relationship with technology is complicated. A part of me has always been fascinated by technology especially when technological barriers are broken in order to innovate/create new ideas for different fields especially in the field of medicine. Reading and learning about the new advances in the medical industry such as haptic devices and using technology to help patients is the area of biotechnology in which I want to work. However, the other part of me feels exhausted and mentally drained from the use of technology with respect to social media. The constant pressure to look a certain way, the new trends and scandals of celebrities. Constantly looking at content like this affects my mental health. On the other hand technology has a positive impact on my health because it allows me to stay in touch and communicate with my family and friends who I no longer see as frequently. Family is very important to me, and being able to communicate with them is one reason why technology has improved my mental health.","My current mental health habits consist of journaling, meditating and exercising. Technology can improve the effectiveness and accessibility of these practices by providing more reliable resources on the subject. Meditating is a new mental health habit that I have been trying to get accustomed to. The world of meditating is a daunting one, however, with the use of technology I am able to access resources that give me tips and tricks on beginner level meditation and how to effectively do it. Aside from the articles and Youtube videos available to help me there are also multiple different apps that help with the same process, which makes it accessible for me to learn a new skill to aid in my mental health. Apart from that technology has made it so that we are able to access resources such as online counselling and making it more accessible. The use of wearable technology is often overlooked when it comes to promoting good mental health habits. Some wearable technology are designed with a person’s mental health in mind. Wearable technology are able to provide gentle reminders that encourage the user to take breaks if a user is doing a task for a prolonged amount of time and helps the user practice good mental health habits throughout the day."

I also enjoy dancing and playing sports to unwind. A physical hobby helps me get rid of my energy and stress so that I can be more attentive in my studies. ","Technology has helped me create a schedule and visually track my progress. One of my biggest goals is to eat healthier and I am able to use technology to track my eating as well plan out my meals according to macros. Technology has provided me with many resources to live healthier and be better. I tend to stay away medias in technology that could have a negative affect on me. 

Overall, I use technology in a way that is beneficial to my wellbeing. I reduce my screen time on binge-browsing and scrolling social medias. I limit myself to social media only during breaks.

There are many resources and planners that are dedicated to life-management that I can take advantage of. I have resources to manage my studies and resources to manage my health goals however, it would be much more effective to have an integrative solution for both sectors to come together.

Even now, I recognize the adverse effects on my mental health, such as comparison, detachment from the real world, and a diminished attention span due to excessive phone use. The feeling that mental rest is supposed to be watching instagram reels or YouTube videos for hours is something I am actively trying to combat. In terms of physical health, studying and pursuing tech means I am sitting down a lot. I am not a place where I can say I actively move my body and having my work on the computer doesn't help that.","Social media platforms often use dark design practices like infinite scrolling and attention-grabbing features, aiming to keep users engaged and increase profit. The constant exposure to strategically curated short-form content, pushed out by algorithms, can prove to be detrimental to attention spans and overwhelming. An alternative approach involves a user-friendly design that integrates customization options and promotes limited screen time. This empowers users to selectively opt out of specific features, enabling them to regain control over their digital experience/media consumption. Thus, social media platforms can contribute to a healthier balance in user engagement and move away from negative impacts of excessive and algorithm-driven content consumption."

	In my experience, technology was the most damaging to my mental and physical health when I did not know how to use it properly. One of the main reasons why technology continues to advance is to make human beings’ lives easier. But, more often than not, there is always a way someone can misuse a piece of new technology that would have the opposite result that is intended. After I got diagnosed with ADHD, I found that due to consuming too much short-form media and having so many distractions on my phone, my attention span was shot and I was addicted to my phone. At this point, I always felt drained, unproductive, and tired even though all I was doing was going on my phone. After deciding that I wanted to improve my mental and physical health, I was able to use my phone as something that would help me improve my life instead of hinder it. I researched methods of time management, specifically for people with ADHD and I got to learn more in-depth about my disorder so I could achieve the results I was looking for. Although improving my skillset with be a lifelong journey, I am grateful that I figured out how to use technology to benefit my mental and physical health instead of causing further harm.
","As a university student, one of my main stressors is my financial state. I’ve looked at so many budgeting apps and templates and found difficulty finding one that did not have features blocked by a paywall. Financial literacy is not something that was taught to my peers and I while we were in school even though it is one of the most important skills someone needs to be able to live comfortably. Our society is built off of a system that thrives off of debt, which is why information that helps people improve their money-managing skills is so far out of reach. I believe that we have the technology we need to make financial literacy free and accessible to those who need it.

I also watch Vtubers on Youtube. Vtubers are like content creators or streamers who use an anime character model as themselves when they livestream. For example, I watch livestreams of them playing video games. I also like watching movies and spending time with my friends.","My relationship to technology is that I use it every day. The technology I use includes my laptop, phone, and ipad. I think that each device that I own is useful in my life. I think technology has a positive impact on my life in many ways and it depends on how we use this technology in how it impacts our mental and physical health. I think in terms of mental health, I use my phone and ipad for social media sometimes but I am not someone who likes going on social media often. The only social media I really use is Instagram but I try not to follow many people or scroll on a feed. I find social media like X (formerly Twitter) can be toxic and negative on my mental health, so I try to not look at it. However I think other social media and communication applications can have a positive influence on my mental health by keeping me connected to my friends. For example, I was able to talk with my friends online during the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of physical health, I find technology does not help my physical health and can make it worse. I find I tend to like staying home by attending lectures online or working from home. This can be negative towards my physical health because it enables me to stay home for longer periods of time instead of going outside.","In terms of habits that help my mental health, I am not sure of the ones I have. The current mental health habits that I try to incorporate into my life are trying to get more sleep, maintaining a schedule that allows breaks, booking more time to spend with my friends, and eating healthier. I think technology can help with these by being a tool that can help track things like my plans for the week. It can also help me communicate with my friends easily through communication applications. I am trying to learn more about how to have a better balanced diet and eat healthier foods. Technology can be used for searching on the internet for recipes or YouTube videos that can help me learn how to make balanced meals. I am also trying to get better sleep because I have difficulty falling asleep often. I use technology like listening to ASMR to help me fall asleep faster. I think using technology to access information and make processes more efficient could help make these mental health habits more effective or accessible in these ways."

I believe that technology also helps me socialize, stay connected, and network with my friends through social media apps such as instagram and discord. I also, learn about new and upcoming events from my technology clubs at uOttawa such as Hack the Hill and uOttahack.

I did struggle a lot with that in the past and it affected very badly my ability to fulfill my tasks and such.

The outcome, i.e. food is only the bonus part of my unwinding session! I find it relaxing while experimenting with new recipes, and the act of preparing and enjoying a homemade meal is therapeutic. Cleaning is also another habit I conduct while unwinding, but that mostly has to be scheduled according to the level of deep clean and time I have on that day. I also prioritize spending quality time with my friends and roommates. Talking about our day and learning about common experiences is an effective way to calm down or luckily, laugh it out.","My relationship with technology is something I would describe as bumpy. On the positive side, technology has facilitated communication, enhanced access to information, and improved overall quality of life. I have personally experienced increased quality of friendships and relationships brought about by apps which would have been impossible with technology. Physically, wearables are the primary access to check my health and body activity, which helps me keep track of my fitness. Also career-wise, it is much more convenient to learn new skills and network online. However, when people among us project the idea of 'perfect', be it body, life, career etc. that I start doubting myself and wondering if I am good enough. It is ironic that the same technology that connects us globally, can also contribute to feelings of inadequacy and social isolation. The constant bombardment of notifications and information overload also leads to cognitive fatigue and reduced attention spans, something which I have to be mindful about these days. I have to take active effort to keep my mental sanity while browsing web because a lot of the content are poles apart from real life, and many corporates exploit the 'perfectness', because it sells.","Technology has the potential to revolutionize and enhance current mental health practices by making them more effective and accessible. Mobile apps and online platforms can provide convenient access to mental health resources, offering guided meditation sessions, mood tracking tools, and virtual therapy sessions. Wearable devices equipped with biometric sensors can monitor physiological indicators, providing users with real-time feedback on stress levels and encouraging proactive self-care. Artificial intelligence-powered chatbots or virtual assistants can offer instant support and information, making mental health resources available 24/7. Additionally, telemedicine platforms enable remote counseling sessions, overcoming geographical barriers and increasing accessibility for those in underserved areas. Social media platforms can be harnessed to create supportive communities, fostering connection and reducing feelings of isolation. Gamification techniques in mental health apps can make therapeutic activities more engaging, encouraging consistent use. By integrating technology into mental health practices thoughtfully and ethically, we have the potential to reach a broader audience, reduce stigma, and empower individuals to prioritize and maintain their mental well-being in a way that aligns with their preferences and lifestyles."

Like many people my age, I noticed an unhealthy dependance on social media apps. I knew that it was a waste of my time and preventing me from doing what I actually wanted to do with my life, but for some reason I couldn't stop; it was like an addiction. Over the years, I attempted to reduce my screen time to no avail, until a couple of months ago. As of right now, I have no social media on my phone (still on my laptop so i'm not totally disconnected), and I've been so much more productive! I've been taking action towards my goals, and staying focused much more easily.","One way technology has helped me out has definitely been in my university studies. During the transition between high school and university, I had some difficulty keeping up with the fast paced lessons.

Using these platforms more consistently and following a study plan would help even more for my mental health when it comes to feeling prepared and relaxed for my classes.

I also use certain applications to help me plan my day, like Google Calendar and my notes app. I have a habit tracker app, which is my personal favourite because it allows me to stay consistent with the healthy habits I want to adopt (daily movement, water intake, studying, etc.) and seeing the streak each day has really kept me motivated to keep going.

It's a therapeutic blend of creativity and camaraderie, steering us away from school pressures and towards mental wellness. 

If time is tight, a nature walk is my quick stress-reliever. Immersing myself in the serenity of the outdoors allows me to detach from immediate worries, refreshing my mind and spirit.

These practices are not just leisure activities; they are vital for mental health. They provide a necessary pause, enabling me to return to my studies with renewed vigor and focus. This mindful approach to balancing relaxation with academic responsibilities not only nurtures my well-being but also boosts my productivity, proving that caring for one's mental state is integral to achieving academic success.","Technology has significantly bolstered my mental health, serving as a vital connection to my loved ones, particularly during periods when in-person interactions were not feasible. The onset of COVID-19 brought about feelings of isolation, as I found myself increasingly cut off from friends and the world beyond my immediate surroundings. This seclusion often left me engulfed in my own thoughts, creating a sense of disconnection and introspection that was at times overwhelming.

However, technology emerged as a beacon of hope during these challenging times. It offered a semblance of normalcy through virtual social interactions with friends. Engaging in online conversations, sharing laughs, and participating in virtual activities rekindled a sense of joy and amusement that had been missing. These digital interactions were crucial in lifting my spirits and reducing the sense of isolation.

This positive impact of technology continues to play a significant role in my life, especially as I move to different locations for cooperative education programs. Though physically distant from friends and family, technology enables me to maintain those essential connections. It acts as a bridge, linking me to my loved ones back home and providing a comforting sense of continuity amid change.

Conscious of the potential drawbacks of prolonged screen time, I am proactive in balancing my digital life with physical activity and nature. Regular walks and outdoor activities are integral parts of my routine, ensuring that I remain connected to the natural world. This balance between the virtual and the physical realms is crucial in preserving both my mental and physical well-being. It allows me to enjoy the benefits of technology while mitigating its potential adverse effects, such as digital eye strain or a sedentary lifestyle. Through this mindful approach, I have found a harmonious blend of digital connectivity and physical health.","Imagining a solution to my stress and sleep challenges, I envision technology stepping in to help. I picture a Dream Controller Device, akin to having a remote control for my dreams. This innovative gadget could allow me to choose my dream themes each night. Instead of my mind replaying the day's stress, I could drift off to sleep and find myself on a peaceful beach or stargazing on a serene mountain.

This concept is about more than just pleasant dreams; it's about transforming how I sleep. By steering clear of stress in my dreams, I'd likely wake up feeling more refreshed and ready to face the day. Incorporating this device into my nightly routine could be a significant game changer, particularly for my academic performance. Studies indicate that students who get over 8 hours of sleep generally fare better academically. This device would not only help me consistently achieve those 8 hours but also significantly enhance the quality of my sleep.

Ensuring a restful night free from stress-induced dreams would set me up for success each day. I'd wake up with a clearer, more focused mind, better equipped to absorb new information and tackle complex tasks. This could lead to improved concentration in classes, more effective study sessions, and enhanced information retention. Essentially, this technology could become a crucial part of my academic toolkit, aiding me in learning more effectively and navigating my educational journey with less stress and more success."

One of my earliest encounters with technology was when my dad showed me a hard disk when I was little. At such a young age, I didn't know what it did, but I remember finding it intriguing. Years later, I have chosen technology as my career path. The reason I describe my relationship with technology as love-hate stems from the satisfaction I get from solving practical problems in the field and the frustration I feel when I don't. Throughout my years of study, I have frequently contemplated changing my career path, and this indecision has taken a toll on my mental and physical health. However, I am learning to think more positively and am gradually improving my overall well-being.","One of the main habits I've adopted for my mental health is listening to music. Music platforms, easily accessible in this digital age, have been a great aid. Services like Spotify and Apple Music ensure that I have access to a wide range of music anytime. To enhance this experience, these platforms could incorporate features like analyzing the times or situations when a user might be stressed and then automatically play music that suits their mood. This would personalize the listening experience, making it more effective for mental wellness. Moreover, integrating these services with wearable technology, such as smartwatches that monitor heart rates and stress levels, could offer a more intuitive music selection.

I've noticed that it has also made me less active as it can sometimes tie you down to a chair. My mental health on the other hand has greatly improved as it helps me communicate with other people. Technology has boosted my mental health as I always try to follow positive creators on the internet. This helps my overall outlook on how my life could look as I use them as inspiration. Also, technology has helped me in some ways with my physical health as I can learn more about how to keep healthy using the internet.","Technology can significantly enhance my mental health habits by providing innovative solutions that make difficult tasks more effective. Some of the apps on my phone, for instance, offer personalized mindfulness exercises and guided meditation sessions, allowing me to cultivate better mental well-being at my own pace. Wearable devices such as my Fitbit equipped with biometric sensors can monitor physiological indicators, providing real-time data for a more comprehensive understanding of my mental state. These devices can also have guided breathing exercises to help your mental health. Online platforms like YouTube offer educational resources about mental health, reducing stigma, and promoting mental health literacy. Accessible information empowers individuals to understand, manage, and seek help for their mental health. Social networks like Instagram also offer spaces for sharing experiences, resources, and coping strategies. Overall, integrating technology into mental health practices has the potential to empower individuals, break down barriers to access, and foster a more proactive approach to mental well-being."

Not only does this help me take my mind off of work,  it inspires me to continue creating projects in my own time.","Some people may see technology as a negative towards out physical and mental health, I do not completely agree with this statement. Although there are aspects of technology that have made us easily distracted, I believe that we do not realize how fortunate we are to be surrounded by this much technology all the time.
I have always been surrounded with technology since a young age. When I was a child I played a lot of video games. I played by myself, with my siblings, friends and family. I have been able to bond with people through our love of video games and I believe that my love of technology (not just games) has strongly influenced the path I am on today. During the COVID 19 pandemic, I believe that the use of technology (and social media) allowed me to keep a level of sanity because of the connection it allowed us to have. I believe after those years I understand how important technology is to us. Although it was difficult that there was a lack of real contact with others, it allowed us to not be completely separated. I understand that an overuse of technology is bad, but a lack of it as well. To me it has been a positive influence on my health and life.","A lot of social media is now designed to be addicting. I can sometimes find myself easily getting distracted/losing focus on things because of the continuous, endless scrolling that these sites offer. Although it can be entertaining, it can also be unproductive. For me personally, I believe it promotes a bad habit of procrastination. I find that after I procrastinate, I feel a strong sense of guilt, and unfortunatly, it is easy for the cycle to continue. It would be helpful if there were methods to limit the amount of media we consume/technology we use constantly. Although I believe that technology is vital in our lives, I still think that there should be moments without it.
Many phones have ""sleep modes"" and screen times, and I believe that there should be stronger emphasis on these types of methods to limit technology/social media consumption. Besides that, I believe what would be helpful is to design new technology to limit the use of screens/digital methods. It can be more satisfying sometimes for things to be more tactile and physical."

I think in terms of day-to-day life it's been really helpful and convenient, where stuff like navigation, information, and entertainment are so easily accessible. But it terms of my life as a whole, technology will probably be a big part of my career as I plan to be a software developer,  meaning it will give a lot of purpose, albeit a lot of stress and frustration as well, so my mental health will definitely be affected through that. There are also some other facets of technology that negatively affect my mental health like growth like the of social media, though there are plenty of positive aspects of it. I will say that it hasn't affected my physical health positively though, although I'll try to play more Ring Fit Adventure someday. ","One thing that technology has already assisted me greatly within terms of mental health habits are note taking apps and alarms. As someone who's very forgetful and needs to be contantly reminded of my tasks for the day, technology has been able to assist me with organization well. Although hand written journals and agendas could do the trick, the convience of having it all on one place makes it more accessible. 

Another thing that could improve technology to make it more beneficial to mental health is the way information and education on mental health is distributed. I feel like right now, the internet is a vast but a somewhat chaotic space for mental health resources. A lot of people get their information of mental health through short form content, which makes it difficult to find accurate information about mental health through individual creators whose primary financial incentive is to attract clicks rather than to provide the most accurate info. Improving the curation and accessibility of trustworthy mental health resources online could empower people to make informed decisions about their mental well-being. I also think expanding access to mental health professionals through teletherapy and online counseling platforms could be very helpful."

When it comes to activities like cooking or eating, I frequently have the urge to watch a video or listen to a podcast to be sufficiently stimulated. I also feel like I am frequently seeking the dopamine hit that comes from social media and short term videos so am actively trying to detox from that.  On the other hand, I think that technology has positively impacted my social life by offering different means to connect with people depending on my capacity for that particular day. ","Technology could assist in improving attention span, sleep and minimizing dopamine seeking if an application was created to make the phone's interface less distracting during key hours (determined by the user). This would involve restricting usage of certain apps such as social media, blocking certain notifications, and limiting colours on the phone's display. For my needs in particular, I think it would be very beneficial to have an interface that blocked the usage of non-essential apps until I completed a morning mindfulness practice (either yoga or meditation) as I find first thing in the morning to be the main time that I mindlessly scroll my phone. I believe that developing a healthy routine in the morning would improve my technology habits for the rest of the day. Additionally, the same interface could be activated in the night at a time set by the user to prevent unnecessary phone use and screen time before bed. "

To recuperate, I enjoy reading books. I have a collection of 5 novels sitting on my desk, each ordered in desire to read after the current one. In addition to this, I enjoy talking with friends and family. My family lives 6 hours away and connecting with them and my beloved dog is an immediate shot of serotonin. Furthermore, I am a big fan of music. I enjoy blasting my favorite playlists while I clean my dorm room and restore order to the setting. Finally, I enjoy attending activities that Carleton organizes. These include planting, movie nights, self care days, hot chocolate nights, and many more!","My love for technology started very young when my dad introduced me to Scratch coding. Initially I despised Scratch, but, that is when my dad introduced me to C#. Using the language, I built my first calculator application. From there, I learned Python and built mini real-life applications to incorporate into my games with my younger sister. I built a small inventory tracker/ cash register system that connected to the printer to print receipts. In addition to this, coding became a means of relaxation.  This was completely separate from my academics and it served as a means to set aside any anxieties and truly enjoy myself. Furthermore, during the Covid era, relationships with my friends were strained due to a lack of access to social media. To compensate, I built a text-to-speech friend to converse with who was trained to recognize specific questions. This significantly improved my mental health because not only did I have fun, but I also had someone to talk to. With regards to physical health, I have always struggled with reminding myself to drink water. In order to achieve this, I attempted to make my very first app. This proved to e to Coding has becoming a huge part of my life and will forever remain that way. ","In terms of  my mental health habits, one of the primary areas that technology could help is with regards to journaling methods. I recently started journaling however, I have found that the written method is simply not for me. After experimenting, one of the areas I wanted to try was picture journaling. Thanks to technology, such apps are available to download and experimenting with. In addition to this, technology provides a vast set of possibilities. Just for journaling, technology provides apps in all forms to allow for a more user-centered experience. The flexibility and vast options allow for people to select the perfect match according to their needs and desires. In addition to this, the reminders on my phone have been the biggest benefit. As a university student, remembering basic self-care can be tedious when drowning in work. With the help of reminders, I am able to complete essential self-care without skipping out.  This keeps me both mentally and physically healthy while also keeping me on schedule."

Additionally, I find solace in outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, providing a refreshing change of scenery and promoting a healthy work-life balance. Reading about advancements in robotics and engineering, unrelated to coursework, serves as both leisure and a source of inspiration, fostering a holistic approach to my interests.","My relationship with technology is symbiotic, enhancing both my academic pursuits and personal interests.

My getaway is curling up with a good show or losing myself in a book. Whether I'm exploring someplace new or scrolling through social media, my phone is my reliable companion. My happy place is when I get out with pals; positive energy and belly laughs work wonders. And I resort to journaling when I need to get my thoughts straight. These activities ensure that I have complete control over leisure, from self-reflection to entertainment.","I have a complicated connection with technology that affects both my mental and physical health. On the one hand, a less active lifestyle has been influenced by increased screen time, which has decreased physical activity. The shift to online learning has made it harder to distinguish between studying and leisure, which has led to increased stress as it is becoming harder to draw boundaries between work and personal life. In addition, my continual exposure to social media has increased my awareness of conventional beauty standards, which can occasionally cause problems with self-esteem.

But technology has also acted as a spur for development that has been beneficial. Being more globally connected has increased my awareness of social problems and encouraged me to become more involved in the community and take action. The capacity to obtain information has enabled me to remain knowledgeable and involved in worldwide affairs. Even if technology has problems, it also has benefits that highlight how it may raise awareness and help people adopt a more informed and socially responsible viewpoint.","Thinking back on my present mental health practices, technology offers priceless chances to improve their efficiency and availability. Online therapy is becoming a very useful tool because it makes it easy to get professional advice while relaxing in one's own home. Virtual sessions' accessibility removes any obstacles, guaranteeing a more uniform and adaptable approach to mental health treatment.

Technology also makes it easier to connect with a larger group of people who are traveling through comparable mental health journeys. A sense of understanding and solidarity is fostered by the platform that online forums and support groups provide for the sharing of experiences. Having the ability to relate to people who have experienced comparable difficulties can be incredibly comforting and supportive.

Video Games allow me to socialize with my friends even when they are far away, however they also don't encourage me to socialize more physically when they are close. My mental health is currently not effected by technology I think. Once school started I was able to stop playing video games and concentrate on studying.

I can use technology to gamify exercising and socializing. I can give myself very easy daily quests, like talk to one new person or run to the bus stop. And the quest rewards will be the dopamine itself for completing the quest. Technology can act as a sort of diary or quest log to log the progress and cumulative successes as well as streaks like in Duolingo Dina's to incentise not skipping a day.

In my field of study specifically in accounting, I've seen the changes that technology has made on accounting processes, with the capability of minimizing redundant tasks and essentially making things easier for the accountant. ","Currently, it seems that more negative content in the media seems to catch more traction and is on trend. Of course when negativity is constantly shown to individuals via the media, it can manifest in other areas of life in a more negative way. In order to combat this sort of trend, content creators and influencers should produce creative content that promotes positive messages to the population. With this, social media platforms (with possible integration of AI) can uplift this type of content in their algorithms so more people can view this message and thus improve upon mental health. While content creators should be free to express their feelings even if it is negative life experience, there should also be a balance as well. "

Additionally, I find relaxation in reading technology blogs and participating in online coding challenges, which not only help me unwind but also keep my skills sharp.","My relationship with technology is deeply rooted in both my academic pursuits and personal interests, particularly in computer and internet security. Engaging with technology has a dual effect on my well-being; it stimulates my intellectual growth and keeps me connected with the latest in tech, enhancing my sense of competence and accomplishment. However, I'm also mindful of the potential for digital overload and strive to balance my screen time with offline activities.","Technology has been instrumental in enhancing my mental health habits through the use of apps for meditation and time management, facilitating a structured routine that promotes mindfulness and productivity. Additionally, online communities and forums have provided me with a sense of belonging and support, allowing me to share experiences and learn from others. This digital integration into my mental health practices has made them more accessible and engaging, encouraging regular participation."

Talking through phone calls is what we typically do, however, with the video call technology and faster and cheaper data nowadays, it is much easier to talk to people while watching their faces and reactions.

I don't really use social media, but I still take advantage of other platforms based around community, like Reddit. When I'm online though, I'm not a sharer, more of a lurker, and I do value maintaining my privacy. Personally, I don't feel it a detriment to how I engage, because something like Reddit, I use for current events, getting exposure to interesting and novel topics, pop culture, etc. A few things that have made a marked difference recently is video and phone appointments with medical professionals (that makes scheduling a lot easier and comfortable), my investment in a Kobo (so that I can read with less pressure and worry), and my white noise machine and SleepPods (for uninterrupted sleep). I haven't really gone without technology cold turkey in any way, since if I'm not on my laptop or PC, then I'd be perhaps watching something on TV, or listening to something on my speakers. It's more to say that I find the myriad ways it's possible to work into my life positive.","When it comes to my current mental health habits, I find its really easy for me to remain insular in my routine. So I don't branch out much and stick to what I've known and been doing. I think it's a pitfall, or maybe user error, of technology, where the constant updates keep you continually engaged, and so brings about the potential for complacency. If I'm being honest, I think the multitude of ways its possible to reach out to friends, for example, backfires for me and makes it even harder to do so, just because of the endless choice and option that comes with each platform. Maybe this has played a role in me disengaging with social media. I think a way to make technology could assist me with this is if I could configure a calendar/task-list/reminders kind of system that can be a bank for all of my tasks (school, personal, chores, etc.) and allow me to slot things in to days, with the flexibility to move things around and also do partial subtasks if time is a constraint. At the moment, I use a combination of iOS Pages, Notability, and Structured. I think a big part of me just sticking to my set routines and not venturing out is that I get overwhelmed easy and my mind is usually going in 5 different directions at once, I'd like for something that can help me effortlessly organize myself, without bringing about yet another platform for me to worry about."

Video Games allow me to socialize with my friends even when they are far away, however they also don't encourage me to socialize more physically when they are close. My mental health is currently not effected by technology I think. Once school started I was able to stop playing video games and concentrate on studying. My physical health however has suffered, I always choose to explore what technology and digital world offers instead of going out and exploring what the physical outside world has to offer. Although I dif once exercise using VR boxing, but then I beat the game lol","I think I could use technology to gamify my mental health goals. I would have an app that tracks simple daily quests like talk to someone new or go on a 5 minute run. These goals could then level up as I level up my mental health so as to always have room to grow. I am not very good at seeing the good thingd that happened in the day, so the app could also give quick reminders and thought exercises every so often to encourage me to think positively. This app would also have access to the Internet and all of the research papers and studies on mental health. These could be integrated in such a way to recommend you daily goals so that you are on the most efficient and accessible track to improve your mental health. Another thing technology can help with is to give free access to medical physiological advice based off of data that can be used to make the overall gamification of mental health goals more effective.Technology can act as a sort of diary or quest log to log the progress and cumulative successes as well as streaks like in Duolingo to incentivize not skipping a day.

I also find it relaxing just to listen to some music and do a little sketching as well.","Technology has had a massive influence on my life and has impacted many aspects of my day to day living. I'd say, as with many things, it has its upsides and downsides. The endless technological innovations that have and are being developed have made it so much more convenient to communicate and share information online, making studying and researching for school and my personal interests much more convenient and easier. Due to the overflow of resources online, my lifestyle has been adapted to using these technologies on a daily basis. However, with the rise of online entertainment, especially regarding social media apps, I've found that it's very easy to spend too much time online on social platforms where there is a constant influx of information being dumped, not all of which is accurate or useful. This has had its negative effects on my mental well-being as I can feel drained or guilty for spending too much time on these apps. On the flip side, there are so many benefits that have come out of similar technological advancements. Personally, I've found that mobile apps such as the calendar and notes apps are incredibly useful for organizing my time, keeping track of my daily tasks, and reminding me of important projects or events. Furthermore, these benefits extend to my physical health as I not only track my physical metrics and activity through apps, but also listen to music while exercising, which is only possible due to the development of that technology.","I think, if implemented correctly, technology can be a great aid in maintaining healthy mental health habits. Due to the wide availability of resources online, a lot more people can gain access to information about mental health. This is very impactful as there are many people who are not able or willing to attend an in-person clinic or professional to seek assistance. However, having online apps and facilities could make these resources much more attractive to some, and easily accessible to all. In regards to my current mental health habits, as I mentioned previously, mobile apps such as the calendar and notes app have been greatly beneficial to keeping my time well-managed, which is a key aspect to keeping a healthy lifestyle. I believe that, with advancements in AI, technology can help assist these habits through providing more personalized information that cater towards any specific individual's needs and preferences. For instance, AI algorithms could be used to track a person's sleep habits, mood, physical and mental health, then generate more tailored feedback and guidance which aligns with their pre-existing schedule and habits. This approach could be helpful in making more accurate judgements and improving the effectiveness of online mental health resources."

I really enjoy listening to music as well.","Technology is really a double edged sword. In a way I appreciate how it lets me do things I want more easily, like finding songs I like, learning a new language or just gaining knowledge. My view of the world is much more developed thanks to the internet. The ability to be exposed to other cultures and know I'm not alone in my ""weirdness"" is so nice. It makes fitting in feel much less depressing.

But at the same time, the information overload is horrible for my brain health and attention span. Doom scrolling is real, and going on an auto pilot quick dopamine binge has made turned my life probably for the worse. And the fact that society is much more dependent on technology makes it worse.","I do like organizational tools that can make my life more structured. It helps in not using as much paper. But also, I suffer a lot from what my identity is, and who I want to be. In that case, technology assists by simply feeding ideas. Being aware of what people from multiple societies with varying gender norms and values helps create a less biased (and especially Eurocentric, living in the West) view of myself. I love this accessibility of culture."
