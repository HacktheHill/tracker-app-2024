üåü **[Design System]()**

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), which is essentially [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) on steroids. You can follow the instructions on the pnpm website to install it. Then do the following:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:HacktheHill/tracker-app-2024.git
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages, with the following modifications:

- The scope must be PascalCase.
- The subject must be Sentence case.

When you hit `enter` after doing a `git commit`, it will trigger a [Git Hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) managed by [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), which triggers a [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) command to verify that your commit message meets the guidelines. Any messages that do not follow the specification will be rejected.

In order to ease the process of writing commit messages, we've configured [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) to guide you through the process of writing a commit message interactively.
You can run `pnpm commit` to use this tool. This will guarantee that your commit messages are formatted correctly.

With time, writing conventional commit messages will become second nature and you will no longer need to use Commitizen.

- Each commit should be a single logical change. Don't make several logical changes in one commit. For example, if a patch fixes a bug and optimizes the performance of a feature, split it into two separate commits.
- Each commit should be able to stand on its own, and each commit should build on the previous one. This way, if a commit introduces a bug, it should be easy to identify and revert.
- Each commit should be deployable and not break the build, tests, or functionality.
- If you're not sure if a commit should be split, it's better to split it if each split commit is deployable and doesn't break the build, tests, or functionality.
- If you made changes fixed changes in a past commit look to use `git commit --amend` to add changes to the previous commit rather than creating a new one; thus keeping the commit history clean and concise.

The use of [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is highly encouraged, as it provides a visual interface to manage your commits, branches, and stashes.

We currently follow a [Trunk-based development](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/topics/automation/version-control/advanced-git/git-branching-strategies/) with a no-merge, no-squash, rebase-only workflow as the project is in its early stages. This essentially means you should always create a branch off `main` in the following format:
`yourname/<conventional-spec>/<issue-number>-<issue-name-kebab-cased>`. For example, `johndoe/feat/1-add-login-page`. Do not do `git merge`, always do `git rebase main`.
This keeps a clean, linear history that is free of merge commits and easy to debug.

Sometimes the issue names are long, in which case you can create them directly by clicking on an issue, and it'll autofill the issue number and name for you in kebab-case.

Always simple rebase your branch onto main before creating a pull request. This ensures that your branch is up to date with the latest changes in the main branch.

Please try to close 1 issue per pull request, and always use the exact same PR title as the issue name.
